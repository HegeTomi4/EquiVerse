# EquiVerse
An NFT horse racing betting platform and blockchain game project made in Unity.

We have developed this demo with two main goals in mind.
1. Show that we imagine a colorful cartoon style world where our magical horses (unicorn, pegasus, cyber horse) can feel at home.
2. Feature an example interactive gameplay mechanic for the gaming part of our project. (Would not be present in races with betting involved. Spectatorship only in those cases.)

To try the game prototype simply download and unzip [EquiVerse_Playable_Windows.rar](https://github.com/HegeTomi4/EquiVerse/blob/main/EquiVerse_Playable_Windows.rar) on a windows system.

Then launch the HorseGame.exe file. <br />
